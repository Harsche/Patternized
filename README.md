This is an educational project that aims to provide an implementation in Unity of each pattern described in the book [Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

You'll find the code for each pattern at the path Assets/Project/<Pattern Name> along with a readme file that explains how the pattern was used and to what end.

Please mind that these are just demonstrations. If you don't know a pattern and how it works, please consider reading the respective chapter of the book and then come here to see a more robust implementation.

## Play
