  <PatternDescription>k__BackingField: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby
    letting users parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests,
    and support undoable operations.
  <HowToPlay>k__BackingField: Click on a tile to make the character walk there. Use
    the undo/redo buttons to see it go back and forth on the same path.
  <PatternUsage>k__BackingField: The character's movement was abstracted to a Walk
    Command that contains an ordered list of cells that form a path and a target
    Character. By saving the Commands in a List, we can make the character undo and
    redo the exact same steps simply by switching Commands and reversing the path
    when necessary.
