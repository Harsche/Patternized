  <PatternDescription>k__BackingField: The Flyweight pattern uses sharing to support
    large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. It is used when the costs
    of creating and maintaining a large number of similar objects are prohibitively
    high.
  <HowToPlay>k__BackingField: 'Press play and start collecting coins to achieve the
    highest score you can, you have 60 seconds. This is the amount of points each
    coin gives:

    Small < Normal < Big

    White < Yellow < Purple'
  <PatternUsage>k__BackingField: By using ECS, we share components between all the
    coins. Instead of creating 1 object for each of the  100,000 coins, we create
    9 and share them among all the coins. This way, we go from 100,000 coin objects
    to 9.
